    - **1. MemoryRepository Performance and Comparison**
      - Includes figures:
        - Figure 10(a) (b) (c) (d).
      - Analysis of figures:
        - (a) shows that retrieval performance slightly decreased with the MemoryRepository.
        - (b) shows that the MemoryRepository did not significantly improve correctness.
        - (c) shows that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 performed well even without the MemoryRepository.
          - The integration of the MemoryRepository did not significantly enhance coherence for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
          - Without the MemoryRepository, ChatGLM performed poorly.
          - With the MemoryRepository, there was a significant improvement in coherence for ChatGLM.
        - (d) shows that the MemoryRepository significantly improved Human-Like performance across all models.
        - Explanation:
          - The MemoryRepository's long-term memory mechanism stores information in the Long-term MemoryRoom through summarization and forgetting processes, discarding less relevant information. This slightly decreases retrieval accuracy but aligns with the goal of focusing on Human-Like and Long-Term Interaction.
          - When a model has coherence issues, the MemoryRepository can provide a significant improvement.
          - If a model already has strong coherence performance, the MemoryRepository cannot offer much improvement.
          - This indicates that the MemoryRepository's memory system endows models without inherent memory mechanisms with both short-term and long-term memory, significantly enhancing coherence.
          - The MemoryRepository provides a notable improvement in Human-Like performance for all models.
          - This is because most models lack a Human-Like memory design, but the MemoryRepository, through its short-term and long-term memory system along with summarization and forgetting mechanisms, makes model dialogues more human-like, thereby significantly enhancing Human-Like performance.
    - **2. Performance Comparison of MemoryRepository and MemGPT**
      - Comparison between MemoryRepository and MemGPT using the four evaluation metrics: Retrieval, Correctness, Coherence, and Human-Like.
        - MemGPT slightly outperforms MemoryRepository in Retrieval.
        - MemoryRepository significantly outperforms MemGPT in Human-Like.
        - Correctness and Coherence are similar for both.
        - This shows that the MemoryRepositoryâ€™s memory mechanism not only enhances long-term interaction but also significantly improves Human-Like capabilities.
      - Includes tables:
        - TABLE 3. Comparison of MemGPT and MemoryRepository-embedded GPT-3.5 Performance in the 100th Round of Dialogue.
    - **3. Performance Comparison of MemoryRepository-Enhanced LLMs Across Diverse Inference Parameters**
      - Includes figures:
        - Figure 11(a) (b) (c) (d).
      - Shows that the MemoryRepository exhibits good diversity and robustness, maintaining its functionality even when model parameters are adjusted.
        - It can improve Long-Term Interaction and Human-Like performance.
